Description
LMI: Performs longitudinal multiple imputation.
GMM_PCA: Implements the generalized method of moments with principal component analysis to estimate parameters.
CS: Conducts cross-sectional mediation analysis following the method proposed by Xue et al. (2022).
MIX: Fits mixed-effects models with time interactions and lasso regularization, based on Rijnhart et al. (2022).
Path: Implements linear structural equation modeling with pathway lasso penalty, as described in Zhao and Luo (2022).
HIMA: Performs high-dimensional mediation analysis using de-biased lasso and false discovery rate control, following Perera et al. (2022).
Bayes: Applies Bayesian sparse modeling with continuous shrinkage priors, based on Song et al. (2020).
